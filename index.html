                            <ul><li>Cooked oats (one-half cup) </li>
                            
                           <li> 1 tsp olive oil </li></ul>
                            
                            Bearings: 
                            
                            <ol><li>Blend oats and olive oil in a bowl, according to the referenced amount </li>
                            
                           <li> Presently apply it on your stopped up pores </li>
                         
                           <li> After 15 min are finished, wash off your face with tepid water </li>
                      
                           <li> Rehash this twice or threefold per week </li></ol>
                            
                            How it functions: Oatmeal scrubs the pores of your skin from profound inside. Also, it retains overabundance of oil. </p13><br>

                            What all you need: 
                            
                            Fundamental oil Jojoba oil is adequate 
                            
                            Bearings: 
                            
                            <ol><li>Discuss influenced skin</li>
                                <li> Apply Jojoba Oil to the obstructed pores.</li> </ol>
                            
                            In any case, do this consistently. No 'blending' needed with some other oil. Simply a flimsy layer of Jojoba oil is sufficient 
                            
                            How it functions: Jojoba Oil comes exceptionally near human sebum, which is the reason it diminishes sebum creation. Which is the reason it helps in dissolving stopped up pores! </p14><br>

                            How it functions: Hempseed oil is 'normally acceptable' in saturating and purifying. This oil is protected to use on skin inflammation inclined skin as well.
